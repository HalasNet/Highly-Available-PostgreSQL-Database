# Project Description
The aim of this project is to make a user transparent database system capable of losing at least one machine with minimal or zero downtime that also uses the redundant machines to improve performance. These objectives are limited to the local network, meaning that making the internet access redundant is beyond the scope of the project.

# Project Goals
- This
- This
- and that

# What I used, so you can avoid wasting time if you're using different versions or different software :)
- On my PostgreSQL machines I used CentOS 6.5 and installed Postgres 9.4
- For load balancing I used two machines with CentOS 7 and installed PgPool II 3.4.3


# Repository Organization
I'll try to make this as simple to browse and understand as possible, one folder for each machine, each with it's own configuration files and instructions.
This means that there will be some redundancy in the information as some of the configurations are the same for more than one machine but it'll hopefully make it easier to follow.
